CS4280 - Program Translations
Instructor: Dr. Sharlee Climer
Project #P0 

Summary: Program will accept input from different sources, create a binary search tree based on the
first character of the input data, traverse the tree using level-order, pre-order, and in-order traversals,
and print out the results for all three traversals with specific indentations.

2-COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------
Usage: ./P0 
       ./P0 [dirname]
       ./P0 < [dirname]

input file format:
  input file must be a none-empty file consisting of only lowercase letters. 

default settings: ./P0


3-CODE COMPILATION:
---------
In my computer I am able to run the make file an execute with ./P0
example:
>make
>./P0 [dirname]

4-DESIGN DECISIONS & ISSUES
---------
Design Decisions:
I decided to implement the BST using structs, with vector variable for holding the words pushed onto the nodes
Includeded a 'parenter' pointer, and a 'depth' integer for formatting output.
Checking for empty file in main using fscanf before passing the file to be built into a BST
isatty(STDIN_FIELNO) to determine output file prefix
Store user-input and redirection into a temp file for processing
